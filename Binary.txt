The binary search algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted array.
Note that the collection of elements/array must be sorted for the algorithm to work efficiently.
Binary search is one of the searching techniques applied when the input is sorted here we are focusing on finding the middle element that acts as a reference frame whether to go left or right to it as the elements are already sorted. This searching helps in optimizing the search technique with every iteration is referred to as binary search and readers do stress over it as it is indirectly applied in solving questions.

Algorithm :

1.Start

2.Take input array and Target

3.Initialise start = 0 and end = (array size -1)

4.Intialise mid variable

5.mid = (start+end)/2

6.if array[ mid ] == target then return mid

7.if array[ mid ] < target then start = mid+1

8.if array[ mid ] > target then end = mid-1

9.if start<=end then goto step 5

10.return -1 as Not element found

11.Exit
